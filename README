dbus stub library for software that depends on dbus but is largely
functional without it.

TODO:

- [x] Go through ./symbols and implement stubs for everything.
- [x] Finalize headers for dbus.h.
- [x] Make pkg-config file configurable.
- [ ] Figure out where we want to spoof return values.
- [ ] Figure out what else is missing.
